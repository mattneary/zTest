{"name":"zTest","tagline":"Statistical Benchmarking for JavaScript","body":"# zTest\r\nzTest is a benchmarking suite for JavaScript, providing statistical testing of performance \"experiments.\" In statistics, an alternative can be proven superior by the rejection of a null hypothesis - that there is no discrepancy in merit. Hence, zTest operates on the idea of rejecting beyond reasonable doubt the idea of performance being equivalent between two procedures.\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\nThe `zTest` library may be used with Node.js, as in `example.js` in the source, or on the client-side. To perform a test, pass a control function, an experiment function, and a sample size to the `ztest` function.\r\n\r\n```javascript\r\nvar result = ztest(function() {\r\n  var i = 100;\r\n  while(i--);\r\n  return;\r\n}, function() {\r\n  var i = 99;\r\n  while(i--);\r\n  return;\r\n}, 1000000)\r\n```\r\n\r\nResults are encoded as follows.\r\n\r\n```json\r\n{\r\n  \"fns\": [function(){...}, function(){...}],\r\n  \"winner\": 0,\r\n  \"desc\": \"The null was rejected; the control is more efficient.\"\r\n}\r\n```\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
